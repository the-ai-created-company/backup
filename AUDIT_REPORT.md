## 🔍 Audit Analysis

### ✅ Passes Eyeball Test:
1. **Compute is dominant** - 831 ops, 3.9MB - This is correct as it includes VMs, disks, networks, firewalls, load balancers, etc.
2. **AI Platform is #2** - 630 ops, 1.4MB - Makes sense given Google's AI focus
3. **Size/Op ratios are consistent** - Most services have 2-3 KB per operation
4. **Logical groupings**:
   - Infrastructure services (compute, container, run) are large
   - Data services (bigquery, spanner, firestore) are medium-sized
   - Utility services (cloudtrace, serviceusage) are small

### ⚠️ Notable Observations:
1. **CloudTrace** - Only 2 operations (batchWrite, createSpan) - This seems correct but minimal
2. **BigQuery** - High size/op ratio (5.08) - Complex query schemas explain this
3. **Monitoring** - High size/op ratio (4.89) - Metric definitions are verbose

### 📈 Size Distribution:
- **Mega** (>1000KB): compute, aiplatform
- **Large** (500-1000KB): logging
- **Medium** (100-500KB): 13 services
- **Small** (<100KB): 11 services

## ✅ Conclusion
The extraction appears complete. The proportions make sense:
- Compute is ~2.75x larger than aiplatform ✓
- Core infrastructure services are largest ✓
- Specialized services are smaller ✓
- No obvious gaps or missing data ✓

Total: **2,953 operations** across **27 services** = **~18.9 MB** of API documentation
