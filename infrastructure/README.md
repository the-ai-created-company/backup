## Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker (Development)
```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d
```

### Option 2: Cloud Run (Production)
```bash
cd deployment
./deploy-to-cloud-run.sh
```

### Option 3: Kubernetes (Enterprise)

cd kubernetes
kubectl apply -k overlays/production
```

## Architecture

The infrastructure is designed for:
- **Scalability**: From single container to multi-region deployment
- **Security**: Defense in depth with proper IAM and secrets management
- **Observability**: Built-in monitoring and logging
- **Cost Optimization**: Auto-scaling and resource management

## Components

1. **Open WebUI Enhanced**: AI chat interface with MCP integration
2. **MCP Factory**: Dynamic tool creation engine
3. **Autonomous Engine**: Self-managing AI orchestrator
4. **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL for persistence
5. **Storage Layer**: Cloud Storage for artifacts
6. **API Gateway**: Unified access point

## Production Checklist
