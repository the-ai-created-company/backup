# Open WebUI Control Tools

This directory contains the 200+ MCP tools that give Open WebUI complete control over itself, enabling true self-modification and autonomous operation.

## Purpose

These tools allow AI agents within Open WebUI to:
- Create and modify chats, users, and functions
- Manage knowledge bases and RAG systems
- Deploy other agents
- Modify their own code and capabilities
- Control all aspects of the Open WebUI system

## Structure

- `api_endpoints.json` - All 200+ Open WebUI API operations in blueprint format
- `capabilities.json` - Operations grouped by capability type
- `tool_definitions.py` - Clean Python implementations (no bridges/workarounds)
- `integration.md` - How these connect with Google Cloud tools

## Key Capabilities

1. **Chat Management** - Create, update, archive, search chats
2. **User Management** - Create users, manage permissions
3. **Function Management** - Create/update AI functions (self-modification!)
4. **Knowledge Base** - Manage RAG collections
5. **Model Management** - Configure AI models
6. **Memory System** - Persistent context management
7. **Agent Execution** - Run code, deploy agents
8. **System Configuration** - Modify Open WebUI itself

## Integration with Google Cloud

These tools work alongside the Google Cloud tools to create a complete autonomous system:
- Google Cloud tools control infrastructure
- Open WebUI tools control the AI system itself
- Together they enable full self-management
